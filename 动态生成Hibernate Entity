---solution  to POC --------------
I would use bytebuddy in order to generate the new classes dynamically and they would have the @Entity annotation, 
the generated classes are written into a temporary jar file ( e.g. /tmp/myjar.jar )

Using a BeanPostProcessor.postProcessAfterInitialization I would replace the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean with a proxy class.

Also I used the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean .setPersistenceUnitPostProcessors to add an extra processor 
that would process the classes from the newly created jar

So now after creating the new class with bytebuddy I would manually call the 
LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBeanProxy.afterProperties that does all the job of bootstrapping the JPA and hibernate layer , 
I do also set the "hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" property to "update" so that the schema would be created ( I know that this is risky to be done in a production environment ).

Hibernate maps entities to tables, and the metadata is built during bootstrap. So, you can't modify it on the fly while the application is running.

However, as long as you keep on adding new tables without modifying the existing structure, you can address this issue at the architecture level:

You make the class changes you need.
You build the project artifacts.
You deploy the new project artifacts to a new server.
You switch traffic from the old server instance to the new one from the load balancer without any downtime.
Or, just use a NoSQL database like MongoDB with Hibernate OGM since your requirements do not fit very well into a relational database anyway.

---- Re-bootstrap the EntityManagerFactory----------------------PersistenceUnitPostProcessor ---

Firstly, the problem is how to add entity class in hot-deploy. 
We could do it by some tools of swapping (spring-boot-devtools, or maven copy resource). 
Secondly, to architect the different models of an entity, could use JPA Inheritance(https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Inheritance) or JPA row mapper.

If the JPA provider is Hibernate, since Hibernate 4.0,
it's possible to pass directly entities to this JPA provider without declaring them in the persistence.xml file. 
Hibernate will handle the entities on the fly.
