AVAOPTS is an environment variable that can be used to pass Java runtime options to the Java command. 
It is commonly used to specify memory settings, debugging options, and other Java-specific settings. 
It is generally recommended to use JAVAOPTS instead of the older JAVATOOLOPTIONS when running Java applications.
It is generally recommended to use JAVAOPTS in most cases as it works with all Java applications, 
while JAVATOOL_OPTIONS only works with certain Java applications.
