1. Understand Ad Hoc Queries

Ad hoc query = a query not predefined, often exploratory.

Users don’t know in advance what fields, filters, or aggregations they’ll need.

Examples: BI dashboards, analytics, reports, quick investigation queries.

Key requirement: flexible schema and fast query performance, especially for complex filters or aggregations

2. Typical Data Store Choices
Type	Examples	Pros	Cons	Best for
Relational DB (RDBMS)	PostgreSQL, MySQL	Mature, ACID, SQL support, indexes	Complex joins over big data can be slow	Moderate-sized ad hoc queries
Columnar DB / OLAP	ClickHouse, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery	Optimized for aggregations and analytics, fast scan	Less suitable for OLTP	Analytics, BI, dashboards
Document store	MongoDB, Couchbase	Flexible schema, indexing, semi-structured	Aggregation can be slower than columnar	Flexible exploratory queries
Search engine	Elasticsearch	Full-text search, aggregation, filtering	Not ACID, eventually consistent	Text-heavy ad hoc queries, dashboards
In-memory	Redis (with modules), MemSQL/SingleStore	Super fast, can do complex queries with pre-aggregation	Expensive at scale	Realtime analytics, dashboards.

3. Guiding Principles

Know your query patterns:
If mostly aggregations → columnar OLAP DB.
If text search → Elasticsearch.
If real-time → in-memory store like Redis or MemSQL.
Schema flexibility matters:
JSON or semi-structured stores are easier for unknown queries.
Scale and concurrency:
Big data → distributed OLAP (ClickHouse, BigQuery).
Smaller dataset → relational DB is fine.
Combine if necessary:
Many architectures mix OLTP + OLAP + search.
Example: PostgreSQL for transactional data, Elasticsearch for search, ClickHouse for analytics.
